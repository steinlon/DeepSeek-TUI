# CodeWhale for VS Code

Official CodeWhale extension scaffold for local development.

This first slice is intentionally small:

- open CodeWhale in an integrated terminal
- start `codewhale serve --http` in a visible terminal
- check a local runtime through `/health` and `/v1/runtime/info`
- show connection state in the status bar and CodeWhale activity view

It does not expose the full chat webview, VS Code Agent View integration,
inline edit application, marketplace publish workflow, or retry/undo/snapshot
GUI endpoints yet.

## Local Use

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
npm run package
code --install-extension codewhale-vscode-0.8.53.vsix
```

Configure `codewhale.commandPath`, `codewhale.runtimeHost`,
`codewhale.runtimePort`, and `codewhale.runtimeToken` from VS Code settings.

Keep the runtime on `127.0.0.1` unless you deliberately front it with trusted
local networking controls.
