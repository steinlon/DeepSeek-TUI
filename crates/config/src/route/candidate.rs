//! The runtime-resolved executable route (#3384).
//!
//! A [`ReadyRouteCandidate`] is the concrete form of the #2608 contract:
//!
//! > Execution requires a `ReadyRouteCandidate`.
//! > A `ReadyRouteCandidate` can only be produced by `RouteResolver`.
//!
//! Fields are private and exposed only through read-only getters, so the type
//! can neither be *constructed* nor *mutated* outside this crate, and it
//! deliberately does not derive `Deserialize` (so it cannot be fabricated from
//! JSON either). The only constructor is [`ReadyRouteCandidate::new`]
//! (`pub(super)`), and [`super::resolver::RouteResolver::resolve`] is its sole
//! caller. A candidate's existence is therefore proof it passed the resolver,
//! and a candidate's limits are therefore exactly what the resolver produced
//! (including any [`SourcedLimitOverride`]s recorded on it).
//!
//! DEFERRED: #3384's full sketch also carried `capabilities: CapabilityProfile`
//! and `config_snapshot: Config`. Both are intentionally omitted here: pulling
//! `CapabilityProfile` into `crates/config` would force a `tui -> config` type
//! move, and embedding `Config` would couple the candidate to the full config
//! model. They will be added when those types have a home in this crate.
