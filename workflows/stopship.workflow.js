// Live acceptance on DeepSeek Flash and GLM-5-Turbo measured the inherited
// read-only prompt/tool envelope at 17,457 and 17,550 tokens before the first
// useful tool turn completed. Budget 24k per intended evidence turn, then add
// token-neutral max_steps headroom for the required final verdict. The token
// ceiling remains independent and the five role caps still total 360k.

The host's typed run_started receipt already owns the compiled Workflow id and source path; do not re-verify the Workflow alias. You have at most six model responses and must reserve the verdict. Response 1 must make exactly one `grep_files` call with `path` set to `.` and `include` set exactly to [`fleets/stopship.toml`, `crates/cli/src/lib.rs`, `crates/workflow/src/role_resolve.rs`, `crates/tui/src/tools/workflow.rs`], using this high-signal alternation pattern: `name = \"stopship\"|load_named_fleet|start_lane|resolve_workflow_agent|record_task_started|WorkflowUiEventKind::GateUpdated|WorkflowUiEventKind::RunCompleted|stopship_acceptance_fixture_emits_role_gate_and_terminal_receipts`. Set at most 80 results and 2 context lines. Matches outside that exact include list do not count. Do not add generic field names such as `resolved_profile` to the pattern. Do not call `grep_files` more than once and do not call `read_file`, `list_dir`, `file_search`, or any other tool. Response 2 must return the verdict with no tool calls; any later reserved response must do the same instead of gathering more evidence. Treat an exact match naming a call site, typed event constructor, or test assertion in a scoped file as source-owner evidence. Apply this decision rule literally: if you can populate all six required SOURCE EVIDENCE entries from the grep result, return APPROVE; never return BLOCK after citing all six. Return BLOCK only when at least one named owner has no matching citation, and identify each missing owner as MISSING. The first non-empty line of your response must be exactly APPROVE or exactly BLOCK. Do not put any words before that verdict: no confirmation, summary, heading, or phrase such as `Here is the verdict`. After the verdict, include a `SOURCE EVIDENCE` section with concise `path: symbol` evidence for named Fleet loading, role-to-profile resolution, tmux Lane launch, typed task_started, gate_updated, and terminal run_completed receipts.
